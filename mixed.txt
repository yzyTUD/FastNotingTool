	Image segmentation technique is used to partition an image into meaningful parts having similar features and properties
	simplification i.e. representing an image into meaningful and easily analyzable way.
	divide an image into several parts/segments having similar features or attributes.
	The basic applications of image segmentation are: Content-based image retrieval, Medical imaging, Object detection and Recognition Tasks, Automatic traffic control systems and Video surveillance

	Discontinuity detection based approach
	Similarity detection based approach
	category in which edges formed due to intensity discontinuity are detected and linked to form boundaries of regions 
	 thresholding techniques
	 region growing techniques and region splitting and merging
	 These all divide the image into regions having similar set of pixels.
	 The clustering techniques also use this methodology
	Multiple Thresholding
