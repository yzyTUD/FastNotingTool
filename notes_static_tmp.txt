	&q equ. for soot concentration on grid 
	Usually smoke is moving because the air is hot
	 pressure vs. gravity ends up in buoyancy  (hot air rising)

	The Boussinesq approximation is applied to problems where the fluid varies in temperature from one place to another, driving a flow of fluid and heat transfer.
	The fluid satisfies conservation of mass, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.
	Boussinesq approximation
	ariations in fluid properties other than density ρ are ignored
	In the Boussinesq approximation, variations in fluid properties other than density ρ are ignored
	continuity equation for conservation of mass i
	general expression for conservation of momentum of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid (the Navier–Stokes equations) is
	where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion
	conservation of momentum
	conservation of mass
	convection equations
	Density variation due to temperature or soot concentration  is very small
	Use the “Boussinesq approximation”:  fix density=constant
	 but add external buoyancy force in  momentum equation:

	overshooting
	higher order interpolation over the grid fights back  numerical dissipation but has the problem of overshooting

	monotonic Hermite  Interpolation
	monotone cubic interpolation is a variant of cubic interpolation that preserves monotonicity of the data set being interpolated.
	preserves monotonicity of the data set being interpolated.
	Monotonicity is preserved by linear interpolation but not guaranteed by cubic interpolation.
